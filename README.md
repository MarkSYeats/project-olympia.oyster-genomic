# Developing genomic resources to support restoration and protection of the Olympia Oyster in Puget Sound

### Research Objectives:   
1) Produce a draft genome assembly for _Ostrea lurida_.     
2) Determine how environmental information is inherited.      
3) Develop a web-based platform for discovery and collaboration.

**Summary**: 
There is a significant gap in our fundamental understanding of this speciesâ€™ resilience in the face of environmental change, ecological interactions, and population structure. This information is critical to local restoration efforts and to predicting how molluscs will adapt to long-term environmental change. There is recent evidence that oysters have the capacity to respond to environmental change at a rate beyond what would be predicted by genetic variation alone. The overall objective of this research is to produce genomic resources and capacity to understand the response of Olympia oysters to environmental change. Specifically, a draft genome assembly for the Olympia oyster will be produced and used to understand how responses of the Olympia oyster to environmental changes are inherited (i.e., genetic or epigenetic) using restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) and bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq). A web-based platform will be developed based on these resources that will be used for discovery and further collaboration.
